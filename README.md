- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tim Lexa, a recent graduate from Northeastern University, where I majored in Finance and also a received a minor in Data Science. My minor revealing a passion for programming, and so I decided to pursue a formal education in CS. I am currently a candidate for a BS in Computer Sciece at Oregon State Univeristy, with an expected graduation date in August 2022. Among my public repos, you can find some of my school projects, along with a few personal projects I have been toying around with. 

- At the moment, I am still exploring the many disciplines within Computer Science, and so I am still open to hearing about any path within the tech industry that may come up.
