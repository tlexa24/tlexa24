- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tim Lexa, a recent graduate from Northeastern University. I majored in Finance and also a received a minor in Data Science. It was 
through this minor that I found a passion for programming, and have spent the past few years learning more and more about Computer Science
through self-teaching. I was interested in a more formal approach to my CS education, and eventually enrolled in Oregon State University where
I am currently pursuing a second Bachelor's degree, this time in Computer Science. 

- At the moment, I am still learning about all of the disciplines within Computer Science, and have currently have an interest in many different
areas to begin my career in.

- If you would like to get in touch, I am available at tlexa2497@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-lexa-235293127/
