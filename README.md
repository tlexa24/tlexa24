- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tim Lexa, currently a candidate for a BS in Computer Sciece at Oregon State Univeristy, with an expected graduation date in August 2022. Additionally, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Finance from Northeastern University in May 2020. Among my public repos, you can find some of my school projects, along with a few personal projects I have been toying around with. 

- At the moment, I am still exploring the many disciplines within Computer Science, and so I am still open to hearing about any path within the tech industry that may come up.

- If you would like to get in touch, I am available at tlexa2497@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-lexa-235293127/
